        <h2>WHY NEW SKILLS FOR TEACHERS</h2>
        <p>
            Teaching is an art. It requires good patience, strong content knowledge and most importantly the right delivery and tone. I am always praised by friends around me that I am a good teacher. I have a single nick name ‘Prof’ right from my childhood. I will tell you some techniques that can make anyone good at teaching.
        </p>
   <h5> Master your content</h5>
<p>
People will adore you if you speak simple. It goes with teaching as well. You can teach simple only if you understand simple. So first get to learn your content deep. If there are interesting recent updates in what you present, learn them too!
        </p>
   <h5> Design the presentation flow</h5>
<p>
When you learn the subject material, try to organize which goes first and which next. Put in a logical order. Every succeeding content should be based on what preceded it. This justifies why you need to start with a basics review before you move on for the actual content. This will help the audience to see the flow and how things connect.
        </p>
        
        
  <h5>  Assume the audience knows nothing than the obvious</h5>

Organize the content well. It is good to provide or briefly touch on the basics before you speak on the actual content. In this way you gather attention of all audience and actually kindle everyone interest to follow as you add up something to that they already know.

<!--
    Don’t teach to memorize

Every topic has an intuition or a reason behind it. Just because one doesn’t know, never make it as a fact. For example, if you teach math and wish to explain what a Fourier transform is,create an analogy with basis vectors in real space and then use it to explain the formula at hand.

    Motivate through examples or applications

Give an introduction to your topic in such a way which will make the audience actually decide to follow your content. You can easily lose ones attention if you start something very abstract without giving proper motivation. Not always you can get a real life example, in such cases motivate the content with previously introduced concepts.

    Give historical perspectives to great discoveries

Say you are introducing relativity in physics. It is always good to start with a small story about Einstein you may know. Something funny, or something that will induce interest in your target audience. Don’t bore them with timelines as when what was done. Instead you may say “nearly 90 years back there lived a man … “ Your introduction is the most important part of your presentation and a key to good teaching is to always start simple!

    Be confident and develop your unique presentation style

Have a strong mind when you stand before your audience. Use the board or the other available teaching materials for your advantage. It is usually a good practice to write important keywords/formulas on board. It would actually give time for the audience to grasp the material and useful for you to show how things get linked. Try showing visuals, live demos, lab visits etc.

    Give a break

Either you are exhausted speaking all time or the students feel tired to follow the material you present. Beat the heat, give them some spare time to grasp, give a pause for them to relax. Talk something general, may be a joke or current trends. Something like, “before we move on, tell me how many of you saw the last football match..”. This will help you to get back their attention or make them involve in some discussions.

    Give meaningful tasks for them to work on

Give a task which will make them to think in their own feet. Apart from challenging tasks, give one or two tasks which will cover the overall things that you have taught. Practice problems/tasks should make them to learn the usual and attack problems which are challenging.
